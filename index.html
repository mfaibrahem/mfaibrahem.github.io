            The Dead Sea holds a few world records of which 
            one is being the lowest point on Earth.
            As for the degree of salinity, it is located among the four 
            saltiest bodies of water in the world.
            Those special conditions are an outcome of its extreme geo-morphological
            structure, alongside a harsh desert climate.
            These create an environment of constant dramatic changes forming
            a breathtaking landscape, unique and different from any other in the world.

            The Dead Sea is actually a huge lake, located in the heart of the Turkish-African 
            Great Rift between Jordan and Israel. Its length is about 50 kilometers and the 
            average width is 15 kilometers. It was formerly divided into two basins, with the 
            North and South separated by the Lisan (Arabic for ‘Tongue’) peninsula. Since the 
            late 70’s, the surface severely dropped and the Southern basin has dried out. The 
            sea is presently confined to the Northern basin. The surface elevation is now 
            437m below sea level, and its depth is around 380m. A high salinity of around 34% 
            allows no life in the water, although several scientists recently-discovered 
            microorganisms that do survive the outstanding osmotic pressures. The sea is an 
            abundant resource of various precious minerals and millions of tons of potassium, 
            magnesium and bromide are manufactured annually to be marketed around the world.

            Continent shields are in constant move. Mighty forces push some apart, pressing
            others against each other. The Dead Sea valley is a fraction of The Great Rift:
            a fault of some 37,000 miles that was created around 25 million years ago, as an
            outcome of an asymmetric shift between the Asian and the African shields. The 
            Asian shield is shifting northbound about 1cm a year. The rapid movement forces 
            frequent earthquakes along the rift. The fault’s axis’ angles produce an altering 
            opening of ‘holes’ between the two shields. Among those are the “Akaba bay”, the 
            “Dead Sea”, the “Sea of Galilee”, and the “Hula Valley”. Here, around the Dead 
            Sea area, enormous rock layers sank into the magma. Alongside the horizontal 
            shift there’s also a vertical rise. Thus, the lowest exposed place on Earth is 437m 
            below sea level, and lays next to huge cliffs that tower to an elevation of 1750m.

            The deep and steep Rift was filled with water some 3 million years ago, as a result 
            of massive floods caused by the rise of the Mediterranean Sea level. A 320 km-
            long basin covered the rift from the “Hula Valley” until almost 80 miles south to 
            where the Dead Sea is today.

            An elevation of a new anticline at the heart of the “Jessereel Valley” blocked this 
            channel around 2 million years ago, and formed a prolonged lake of 320 km. Its 
            isolation and limited rains led to a constant drop of the surface. Sedimentation of 
            various minerals pushed the salt up, gradually raising its salinity. While water was 
            constantly evaporating, all salt remained locked in the basin. The percentage of 
            salt has exceeded the bearing ability of the water, and tons of salt crystallized into 
            large masses have sunk to the bottom, creating miles high layers of salt beneath 
            the sea. 60,000 years ago, the Dead Sea finally reached its contemporary shape. 
            The deep and narrow form exposed it to significant fluctuations of level. Around 
            25,000 years ago, due to dramatic rainy millennia, the level rose to more than 
            100m above the contemporary one. Around 8,000 BC, the level was more or less 
            stabilized to the one we know today.

            The Dead Sea is located in the middle of the Judean desert. During the summer 
            the temperature rises to over 40ºc and may remain above 20ºc (daytime) 
            throughout the winter. The air is constantly dry, and the average precipitation is 
            less than 2 inch a year. The massive evaporation does not affect the immediate 
            surroundings, but creates a visible constant mist hovering some 300m above the 
            surface. On top of the other medical virtues of the Dead Sea, the high barometric 
            pressure and the mist are perfect filters of UV radiation, attracting tourists from 
            the whole world to sunbathe safely as an effective treatment of several skin diseases.

            One of the unique attributes of the Dead Sea shores is them being a part of a 
            ‘Rain-shed Desert’ – a unique phenomenon. Desert conditions reach some 130 
            kilometers north to the global latitude of the desert stripe, only a few miles east 
            of the green, relatively rich in precipitation area around the Judean Mountains. 
            The latter are drained towards the Mediterranean westbound, but the underground 
            water stream towards the Dead Sea, forming long stripes of fresh water springs 
            which allow many oases to develop in the midst of the harsh desert – a belt of 
            thriving life brimming near the Dead Sea.

            The 20th century has brought an overwhelming growth of population to the 
            Middle East alongside modern technologies. These allowed the locals to utterly 
            seize the water resources, which until modern era kept on feeding the Dead Sea, 
            stabilizing its surface level. The main source was of course the River Jordan which 
            solely supplied a billion cubic meters a year. An additional contribution was the 
            numerous rivers which flow directly to the sea, especially from the East. But these 
            were brutally cut off starting from the mid 60’s.
            Two dams block all the outgoing fresh water from the Sea of Galilee, designated 
            from 1965 for national Israeli consumption. The water of the “Yarmuch”, merging 
            into the Jordan from the Jordanian-Syrian border was channeled at the same year 
            to the Eastern side of the Jordan Valley. The rest of the rivers were gradually 
            captured, today allowing the flow only of water from sulfur springs and waste 
            water that sum up to less than 5% of the original flow, assisted by rare flash-flood 
            water, and local drizzle, altogether a trifle donation, in comparison to the massive 
            evaporation. All these led to a gradual receding of 10-20 inch per year.

            The Dead Sea Works Company had introduced the sea to a fierce reality since the 
            end of the 1970s. Formerly, the Southern shallow basin was used for deliberate 
            evaporation of the water as the primal process in production of the precious 
            minerals. Since the surface dropped to cut off the two basins from each other, the 
            Dead Sea Works started to pump water from the Northern basin and completely 
            dried the southern one. The excessive exploitation of the sea causes a horrific 
            drop of a meter every year, an interference that shutters the eco-system and brings
            about severe outcomes.

            The combination of the drop in sea level alongside the prodigious flow of spring-water
            near the shores creates some interesting phenomena. The rocks circling the Dead Sea 
            are mainly sedimentation of the previous phases of it, and contain mainly aragonite, 
            gypsum and of course, remarkable amounts of salt. Some of the salt is set in huge 
            underground boulders. As long as the surface is kept high, the condensed brine that 
            intrudes the quick rock stabilizes the underground salt crystals. With the drop of 
            the surface the underground level drops as well, leaving the underground salt crystals 
            exposed to fresh water. After several rainy seasons and the assistance of the constant 
            flowing springs, the underground salt-boulders dissolve, leaving underground cavities 
            named which tend to collapse occasionally in various spots around the Dead Sea.

            The first incident occurred in 1981. A bus was parked awaiting hikers near Ein Bokek 
            when a 25m sink hole had opened abruptly under one of its wheels. A few other cases 
            involved injuries of several victims. A comprehensive survey held in the late 1990s 
            led to closing down of the Bungalow Resort, the Navy base and a palm plantation near 
            Ein Gedi, and basically required canceling of all progress plans around the sea. Today, 
            the phenomenon is highly surveilled and under control. Beneath several roads, wooden 
            fortification constructions were set, and huge ramps were built next to holiday resorts, 
            all done to assure the welfare and safety of the visitors.

            The Dead Sea area has become a location for health research and potential
            treatment for several reasons. The mineral content of the water, the low 
            content of pollens and other allergens in the atmosphere, the reduced 
            ultraviolet component of solar radiation, and the higher atmospheric pressure 
            at this great depth each may have specific health effects. For example, persons 
            experiencing reduced respiratory function from diseases such as cystic fibrosis 
            seem to benefit from the increased atmospheric pressure

            that UV rays are partially blocked by the increased cloud cover over the Dead Sea

            Dead Sea mud pack therapy has been suggested to temporarily relieve pain
            in patients with osteoarthritis of the knees. According to researchers of the 
            Ben Gurion University of the Negev, treatment with mineral-rich mud compresses 
            can be used to augment conventional medical therapy

                  taken place before the Israelites came to Canaan, and extensively at the

                  Just northwest of the Dead Sea is Jericho. Somewhere, perhaps on the southeastern 
                  shore, would be the cities mentioned in the Book of Genesis which were said to have 
                  been destroyed in the time of Abraham: Sodom and Gomorra (Genesis 18) and the three other 
                  "Cities of the Plain", Admah, Zeboim and Zoar (Deuteronomy 29:23). Zoar escaped destruction when 
                  Abraham's nephew Lot escaped to Zoar from Sodom (Genesis 19:21-22). Before the destruction, the 
                  Dead Sea was a valley full of natural tar pits, which was called the vale of Siddim. King David was 
                  said to have hidden from Saul at Ein Gedi nearby. <br>
                  In Ezekiel 47:8-9 there is a specific prophecy that the sea will "be healed and made 
                  fresh", becoming a normal lake capable of supporting marine life. A similar prophecy is stated 
                  in Zechariah 14:8, which says that "living waters will go out from Jerusalem, half of them 
                  to the eastern sea [likely the Dead Sea] and half to the western sea [the Mediterranean]."

                  King Herod the Great built or rebuilt several fortresses and palaces on the western bank 
                  of the Dead Sea. The most famous was Masada, where in 70 CE a small group of Jewish zealots 
                  fled after the fall of the destruction of the Second Temple. The zealots survived until 
                  73 CE, when a siege by the X Legion ended in the deaths by suicide of its 960 inhabitants. Another 
                  historically important fortress was Machaerus (מכוור), on the eastern bank, where, 
                  according to Josephus, John the Baptist was imprisoned by Herod Antipas and died <br>
                  Also in Roman times, some Essenes settled on the Dead Sea's western shore; Pliny the Elder 
                  identifies their location with the words, "on the west side of the Dead Sea, away from the 
                  coast ... [above] the town of Engeda" (Natural History, Bk 5.73); and it is therefore a 
                  hugely popular but contested hypothesis today, that same Essenes are identical with the settlers at 
                  Qumran and that "the Dead Sea Scrolls" discovered during the 20th century in the nearby caves 
                  had been their own library.<br>
                  Josephus identified the Dead Sea in geographic proximity to the ancient Biblical city 
                  of Sodom. However, he referred to the lake by its Greek name, Asphaltites.<br>
                  Various sects of Jews settled in caves overlooking the Dead Sea. The best known of these 
                  are the Essenes of Qumran, who left an extensive library known as the Dead Sea Scrolls. 
                  The town of Ein Gedi, mentioned many times in the Mishna, produced persimmon for the temple's 
                  fragrance and for export, using a secret recipe. "Sodomite salt" was an essential mineral for 
                  the temple's holy incense, but was said to be dangerous for home use and could cause blindness. 
                  The Roman camps surrounding Masada were built by Jewish slaves receiving water from the towns around the 
                  lake. These towns had drinking water from the Ein Feshcha springs and other sweetwater springs in 
                  the vicinity

            Intimately connected with the Judean wilderness to its northwest and west, the Dead Sea 
            was a place of escape and refuge. The remoteness of the region attracted Greek Orthodox 
            monks since the Byzantine era. Their monasteries, such as Saint George in Wadi Kelt and 
            Mar Saba in the Judaean Desert, are places of pilgrimage.

            In the 19th century the River Jordan and the Dead Sea were explored by boat primarily by 
            Christopher Costigan in 1835, Thomas Howard Molyneux in 1847, William Francis Lynch in 
            1848, and John MacGregor in 1869. The full text of W. F. Lynch's 1949 book Narrative of 
            the United States' Expedition to the River Jordan and the Dead Sea is available online. 
            Charles Leonard Irby and James Mangles travelled along the shores of the Dead Sea already 
            in 1817-18, but didn't navigate on its waters.<br> Explorers and scientists arrived in the 
            area to analyze the minerals and research the unique climate.
